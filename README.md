# Suduko-Solver
This is the file that contains the code.

# gameboard.txt
This is the file where the starting gameboard is placed. The current board is one where the solver will have the most trouble, it takes 138,000,000 cycles or so to solve. I would recommend using the fast setting for this board, as it will still take a few minutes to solve. 
Inorder to properly use this file you need to replace the blank spaces on the board that you are copying with 0's.
Futher instructions are included in the game itself.
